### Concept
1. **After 10th** :- Student passing out 10th can choose between three stream Science , Commerce and Humanities.
There are various fields of marks which supports some conditions check to predicts stream (Doesn't do some rocket science as its just a mockup)
<br />

2. **After 12th** : Student passing out 12th can choose various courses often confuses them , so they provide there marks and interests to predict
courses they can take up.
